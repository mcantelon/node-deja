deja is a node.js-driven CLI utility for managing the git versioning of home
directory sundries, such as dotfiles and personal scripts. deja was inspired by
the Ruby application [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).

## The Basics

Putting your dotfiles and personal scripts into a Git repository offers a lot
of advantages, but there's one obstacle: Git won't let you clone directly into
your home directory. One can, however, clone a repo to another directory then
use symbolic links to point from one's home directory to the cloned files. This
is no fun to do manually, but deja automates the process.

If you have a Git repository containing your dotfiles, for example, you can
clone this repo, automatically adding symlinks in your home directory to the
items in it, using a deja command like:

    deja clone git@github.com:mcantelon/dotfiles.git

The repo would then be stored at `~/.deja/dotfiles`. If your repo contains
submodules, deja will automatically initialize and update them.

Git repo URLs default to Github and the `.git` at the end of a repo URL can be
left off, so you could also do a quick read-only clone by entering the
following:

    deja clone mcantelon/dotfiles

To update this repo you'd enter:

    deja pull dotfiles

To spawn a new shell inside the repo (to do a `git push`, for example) you'd
enter:

    deja explore dotfiles

NOTE: you can use `go` instead of `explore`.

To remove this repo (and any home directory symlinks) you'd enter:

    deja rm dotfiles

To see all repos you've cloned you'd enter:

    deja ls

To see the contents of a repo you'd enter:

    deja ls dotfiles

If using the `ls` command to view items in a repo, additional information
about each entry may be shown. If an entry is a directory, "dir" will be added.
If there isn't a home directory entry linking the repo entry, "unlinked" will
be added. If there is a home directory entry with the same name as a repo entry,
"conflicts" will be added.

## Linking and Diffing

To remove links to your repo, for whatever reason, you'd enter:

    deja unlink dotfiles

To re-add links to your repo after removing them, you'd enter:

    deja link dotfiles

To see the differences between a repo and what currently exists in your
home directory you'd enter something like this:

    deja diff dotfiles

## Subdirectories

When deja clones, it just adds symlinks to the first level of files and
directories contained in your repo, skipping symlink creation when a file
or directory of the same name already exists in the home directory.

If your repo contains a `bin` directory, but you already have a `bin` directory
in your home directory, deja would skip creation of a symlink to `bin`.

If, however, you wanted to create symlinks in your home directory's `bin`
directory to the contents of your repo's `bin` directory  you could do so by
entering:

    deja link dotfiles/bin

If you did this and changed your mind you could remove the symlinks by entering:

    deja unlink dotfiles/bin

## Editing Files

You can edit a file in a Deja repository by entering something like:

    deja edit dotfiles/.bashrc

This will open your file using whatever editor is specified by the
environmental variable `EDITOR`. If this isn't defined, `vim` will be used.

## Cheatsheets

You can edit cheatsheets, after letting Deja know where you want them stored
(see the following *Configuration* section), by entering something like:

    deja cheat git

This will open a file called "git.txt" in your cheats directory.

A sensible thing to do is aliasing `cheat` to `deja cheat` to save keystrokes.

## Configuration

If you're ultra-lazy, you can set your GitHub username in $HOME/.gitconfig.
You'll then be able to do quick writable  clones like this:

    deja clone dotfiles

Set your GitHub username is $HOME/.gitconfig using the following command:

    git config --global github.user YOUR_USERNAME

If you have files or file types that you'd like deja to not link to your home
directory (such as README files and such), you can specify then in a
.dejaignore_local file in your individual repos (or globally if you create
a $HOME/.dejaignore ignore list). The ignore list uses the same scheme as a
[.gitignore](http://help.github.com/git-ignore/) file.

Note that `.git`, `.gitmodules`, and `.dejaignore_local` are always ignored
during linking and don't need to be added to an ignore file.

If you're using Deja's `cheat` command, you can configure your cheats directory
using a command like the following:

    git config --global deja.cheatpath dotfiles/cheats

## Installation

The easiest way is via [npm](https://github.com/isaacs/npm):

    npm install deja

## Dependencies

deja requires the [wrench.js](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/wrench-js),
[optimist](https://github.com/substack/node-optimist), and
[mingy](https://github.com/mcantelon/node-mingy) node.js modules
(available via npm as "wrench", "optimist", and "mingy" respectively).

deja, of course, requires [git](http://git-scm.com/) to be installed.

## Testing

Testing requires the [expresso](ihttps://github.com/visionmedia/expresso)
and [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) modules (available
via rpm as "expresso" and "should" respectively).

Run the tests by entering:

    expresso
